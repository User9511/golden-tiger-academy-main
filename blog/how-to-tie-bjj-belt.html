        <h1>How to Tie Your BJJ Belt: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
        <p>Tying your BJJ belt correctly keeps it secure during training and ensures you look put-together on the mats. Skip the hassle of a messy knot that constantly comes undone or looks out of place (see below for an example). Instead, try one of these solid methods: <a href="#superlock">Superlock Variation</a> or <a href="#hollywood">Hollywood Variation.</a> Pick the one you prefer and get started!</p>

        <h2>How To Tie BJJ Belt Super Lock Variation</h2>
        <h3>1. Ensure your gi jacket is worn correctly</h3>
        <p>Wearing your gi properly ensures a clean look and helps keep the belt secure during training. Fold the right side underneath the left side for a traditional fit.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-01.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Gi jacket being folded correctly, left hand side of the jacket over the right." />

        <h3>2. Place the middle of the belt below your belly button</h3>
        <p>Take the center of your belt and place it just below your belly button. This ensures the belt sits evenly when wrapped around your waist.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-tie-belt-02.webp" class="blog-image" alt="BJJ belt being placed just below belly button" />

        <h3>3. Wrap behind your back and swap hands</h3>
        <p>Wrap the belt around your waist, crossing it behind your back. Swap the ends to the opposite hands and pull them forward evenly, ensuring equal lengths.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-03.webp" class="blog-image" alt="BJJ belt" />

        <h3>4. Form an X and secure the black-bar end</h3>
        <p>Cross the ends in front of you to form an X. Take the end with the black bar. Pull tightly to ensure equal lengths.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-04.webp" class="blog-image" alt="BJJ Belt" />

        <h3>5. Hold and tuck the tail end</h3>
        <p>Hold the two belt loops in one hand and pull them slightly away from your body. With your other hand, take the end with the black bar and tuck it upward underneath the two loops where you created the gap.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-05.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Tucking the belt tail" />

        <h3>6. Pull both ends to secure tightness</h3>
        <p>Once the tail end is tucked, hold both ends of the belt and pull them firmly in opposite directions to tighten the knot securely. This step ensures the belt stays in place during your training.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-06.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Pulling the belt ends to tighten" />

        <h3>7. Create a large loop</h3>
        <p>Take the piece of the belt that's facing the ground and thread it between the two belt loop layers on your hip. This creates the loop needed to complete the knot.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-07.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Creating a loop for BJJ belt" />

        <h3>8. Thread through the loop</h3>
        <p>Take the black-bar end and thread it through the large loop you created in the previous step.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-how-to-tie-belt-08.webp" class="blog-image" alt="BJJ Belt" />

        <h3>9. Wedge the belt end between the loops</h3>
        <p>Carefully wedge the belt end between the two layers of belt loops. This step helps secure the foundation of the knot.</p>

        <h3>10. Tighten the knot</h3>
        <p>Pull both ends of the belt tightly to finish the knot. Adjust as needed for a secure and neat fit.</p>

        <h2>How To Tie BJJ Belt Hollywood Variation</h2>
        <p>The Hollywood style of tying a BJJ belt is perfect for practitioners who value a clean and polished look. Unlike the Super Lock Variation, which creates two overlapping loops, the Hollywood Variation results in a single, sleek knot. This method ensures the neatest appearance on the mats, making it a favorite for photos, competitions, and anyone who wants their belt to look its best.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>1. Ensure Your Gi Jacket Is Worn Correctly</h3>
        <p>Wearing your gi properly ensures a clean and professional look while helping to keep the belt secure during training. Make sure to fold the right side of your gi jacket underneath the left side for a traditional fit.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-bjj-how-to-tie-belt-hollywood-01.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Properly folded gi jacket with the left side over the right" />

        <h3>2. Place the End of Your Belt at Your Back</h3>
        <p>Take the end of your BJJ belt with the tag or logo and position it at your far hip or back, depending on the length of your belt. This placement ensures even wrapping.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-bjj-how-to-tie-belt-hollywood-02.webp" class="blog-image" alt="BJJ belt positioned at the back with the tag visible" />

        <h3>3. Wrap It Around Twice</h3>
        <p>Wrap the belt around your waist twice, keeping it flat and even as you go. Make sure the layers don’t overlap or twist.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-bjj-how-to-tie-belt-hollywood-03.webp" class="blog-image" alt="BJJ belt being wrapped around the waist twice in a neat manner" />

        <h3>4. Push the Bottom Layer of the Belt Out</h3>
        <p>Adjust the belt so it sits neatly in the center of your stomach. Push the back layer of the belt down and out to ensure both layers sit flat and even.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-bjj-how-to-tie-belt-hollywood-04.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Adjusting the bottom layer of the belt for a neat fit" />

        <h3>5. Create Two Tails Again</h3>
        <p>With the belt adjusted, you should now have two tails. Take the end of the belt with the black bar and thread it up behind the two layers of the belt.</p>

        <h3>6. Pull Both Ends Slightly to Adjust Tightness</h3>
        <p>Pull both ends of the belt to tighten it slightly and ensure they are of equal length before proceeding.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog-bjj-how-to-tie-belt-hollywood-06.webp" class="blog-image" alt="Pulling the belt ends evenly to adjust tightness and length" />

        <h3>7. Make an X</h3>
        <p>Flip the bottom hanging piece of the belt over, then proceed to create an X shape with the two tails. This is a critical step to achieve the neat Hollywood style.</p>

        <h3>8. Pull the Black Bar End Through the Loop</h3>
        <p>Reach through the loop you’ve created and grab the black-bar end of the belt. Pull it all the way through the loop carefully to prepare for tightening.</p>

        <h3>9. Tighten the Knot</h3>
        <p>Once the black-bar end is through the loop, pull both ends of the belt tightly in opposite directions. This secures the knot and ensures a clean, polished look.</p>
